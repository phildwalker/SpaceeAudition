# Goal

This section is meant to help show my general process around:

* ingesting the dataset  
* exploring the results  
* developing the cleaned views  

I am intentionally not spending a ton of time working to clean up the visuals or extensively documenting the results, but I have enable the "show code" functionality as part of the yaml header for this rmd file (eda.Rmd). 

If desired the entirity of the website can be found on github [https://github.com/phildwalker/looma_audition]



```{r setup, include = F}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = 'center')

library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)
# library(pdwtheme)
library(gt)
library(infer)
# To Turn off Scientific Notation Use this.
options(scipen = 999)

source("./src/spacee_theme.R")

# theme_set(theme_minimal())
