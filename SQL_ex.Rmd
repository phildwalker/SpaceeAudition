# Prompt

Each user can have multiple sessions. Write a SQL query that:
- selects the ‘userIds’ with the top 50 average session durations
- selects their full name from the user table as a single new column
*Bonus for adding in a new column for each user and flagging their 3rd longest duration with 1,
otherwise put 0 (put 0 if they have fewer than 3 sessions)
