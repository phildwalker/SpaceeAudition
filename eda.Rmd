# Prompt

Write the code to calculate and plot the Precision-Recall curve for any existing ML model you like. Could be a predictor, classifier, or detector. Use any simple ground truth dataset you like. For example, if you use an object classifier or detector, it could be of dogs and cats, or bicycles and cars, or anything like that. However, the dataset choice is yours. Turn in the code sample, GT dataset, and PR curve plot.
